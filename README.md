# LAB07 - Code Template

Please see problem statement/slides.

## Task1: Sort the cat array by age (QuickSort AND MergeSort)
- Take some time to understand the template code
- Complete the template code (there are `TODOs`)
- Print the cats to check whether they were sorted (by `age`)

## Task2: Search for a cat
- Implement a class `BinarySearch` with a method `searchForCat()` that searches for a specific cat object, given an input (`key` = age)
- Implement a BinarySearch algorithm
- Return the found cat's index or output an expressive error message
- Optional: If you found multiple cats, add the cats to an array
